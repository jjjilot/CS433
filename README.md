From Syllabus:

As both a science and an art, computer and network security has become one of those must-learn disciplines.
This course will be comprehensive, covering both fundamental security topics and practical solutions. Yet,
it is designed to be manageable for effective learning. Here are sample topics (each with a sample question):
- Elementary cryptography (what is the difference between classic cryptography and public-key cryp-
tography?)
- Program security (why virus/worm/Trojan horses are rampant on computer and networks?)
- Protection in general-purpose operating systems (what is access control of memory/address/file/user
account?)
- Designing trusted operating systems (can virtualization or layered design help secure an OS?)
- Security in networks (can a firewall deal with all network security threats?)
- Privacy (Is your email or web visits protected with good privacy?)
- Administering security (how to conduct risk analysis and design your security policies?)
- Legal and ethical issues in computer security (now that we catch an attacker, so what?)

Upon successful completion of the course, students will be able to:
- Understand basic concepts of cryptography, including classic and public key cryptography and use of
encryption;
- Understand fundamental concepts and issues with program security, including buffer overflow, com-
puter viruses, and countermeasures against program threats;
- Become familiar with security methods of ordinary operating systems (OS) and concepts and methods
for trusted OS;
- Become aware of threats in networks and become familiar with common methods in securing networks
and communications, including firewalls and security protocols;
- Understand basic concepts with cloud computing security;
- Grasp essential concepts with security administration, legal and ethical security issues, and privacy;
and
- Developed experience in working on a term-long class project, including skills ranging from identifying
a topic, developing a plan, and executing the plan.
